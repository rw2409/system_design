## Tables
1. Primary Key
  1. Simple (PartitionKey Key): PartitionKey used as hashfunction input, has to be unique
  2. Composite (PartitionKey, SortKey): **PartitionKey** used as hashfunction input, items with same hashkey stored together, but must have different **SortKey**

2. Read/Write Capacity
  1. Read Capacity Unit: The number of strongly consistent reads per second of items up to 4 KB in size per second. For eventually consistent reads, one read capacity unit is two reads per second for items up to 4 KB.
  2. The number of 1 KB writes per second.

Capacity increases in proportion with item size, read/write request rate, consistency(strong read = 2*eventually consistent read), local secondary index will also consumes read/write capacity. [Details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html)


##Best practices
* When bulk uploading data, you can achieve higher throughput by spreading evenly across hash key values.
* Uniform Workload: generating requests evenly across your table in order to avoid throttling.
* Spread expensive Scan or Query requests out over time to avoid bursts
